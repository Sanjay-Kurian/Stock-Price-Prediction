# Stock-Price-Prediction

To run this code:
1) Install requirements using 'requirements.txt' file.
2) Run the 'stock_prediction_lstm.ipynb' file.
3) We implemented the Random Forest Regressor model and neural network models from Scikit-learn and tensorflow to predict the closing stock price of Google. We also used hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV to improve the model's performance by finding the optimal combination of hyperparameters. The best model was then trained with the selected hyperparameters and evaluated on the testing dataset using mean squared error and R-squared score. The resulting model can be used to predict the future closing stock price of Google with reasonable accuracy.
